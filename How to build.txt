--------------------------------CMake (Primary)

You need to have CMake on your computer (on macOS the homebrew version might cause problems).

Build flags to keep in mind:
 - COMPLEX_USE_INTEL_IPP (bool) - if you have Intel IPP from oneAPI you can accelerate the FFT with it,
   it is discovered through CMake without needing to provide a path

 - COMPLEX_COPY_PLUGIN_PATH (path) - not important unless you're planning on doing development work;
   you can specify a destination of your vst3 folder. (keep in mind that on Windows this will not work 
   because of permissions. It's recommended to make subfolder and provide that path).
   This will only work if JUCE_COPY_PLUGIN_AFTER_BUILD is enabled.

 - JUCE_ENABLE_MODULE_SOURCE_GROUPS (bool) - only for devs, allows you to see the juce modules inside 
   your IDE


To build:
You have to invoke "cmake" with the "CMakeLists.txt" directory and your build directory
    (i.e. "cmake -S <source_dir> -B <build_dir>")
while providing any flags you might need by prepending -D
    (i.e. "cmake -S <source_dir> -B <build_dir>" -DCOMPLEX_USE_INTEL_IPP=1 
           -DCOMPLEX_COPY_PLUGIN_PATH="C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3\DEV")

Alternatively you can use cmake-gui and fill in all the fields you need.

--------------------------------Projucer (Secondary)

This is kept as a backup but if you already have JUCE installed on your computer 
(or you build it from JUCE/extras/Projucer with CMake) you can use that one too. 
Though I can't promise that the build file will always be up-to-date.
